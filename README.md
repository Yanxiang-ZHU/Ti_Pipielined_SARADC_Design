### OBJECTIVES:

Build a clock-interleaved Pipelined-SAR ADC through MATLAB modeling. The pipelined stages are not limited, the number of clock calibration channels is no less than 4, the precision is no less than 12 bits, and the total sampling rate of the TI-ADC is no less than 2 GS/s. Manually add the following errors and mismatches, such as the sampling clock jitter range of 100 fs to 5 ps, the timing skew range of 200 fs to 5 ps, and the inter-stage gain error of Â±10% (the above parameters are for reference only). Analyze the influences of TI mismatch (gain mismatch, offset mismatch, and timing skew), inter-stage gain error of pipelined-SAR ADC, capacitor-DAC mismatch of the first-stage SAR ADC, comparator offset, and clock jitter through static analysis methods and dynamic analysis methods.Finally fix the time skew.
